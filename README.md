# This is not solana swap.
Have you seen tokenAmountIn and tokenAmountOut in txns? This script will calculate those amounts.
You can extract the solana swap from my solana-sniper project. [Click me](https://github.com/kokiez/solana-sniper/tree/main/raydium)

# Raydium Compute Tokens or SOL
The script will approximate the following:
  1. Approximate SOL to Tokens
  2. Approximate Tokens to SOL

It is same as getting price from birdeye or dexscreener vs approximating directly how much your invested sol is worth now.
